How can I donate?
Simply select an organization from the list of categories.
Before bringing your items to the organization, we recommend checking their website and/or calling to ensure that they accept that particular item.
Even if an organization lists an item on their website, they may not be accepting it at the moment due to space limitations.
Please be aware that many organizations cannot accept items in poor or broken condition.

If you don't see any recommendations for where to take your items, we recommend trying:
